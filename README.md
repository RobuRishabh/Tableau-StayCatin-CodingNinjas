# Tableau-StayCatin-CodingNinjas
This GitHub repository contains a Tableau project aimed at analyzing and visualizing data from StayCatin.com, an online platform for booking short-term rental properties similar to Airbnb. The project was designed to assist StayCatin.com's management team in making data-driven business decisions by providing critical insights into property performance, pricing strategies, and customer reviews.

## Problem Statement

As a business analyst at StayCatin.com, the objective was to create a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to answer key business questions and offer valuable insights to the management team. The dataset includes detailed information about each property listed on the platform, including reviews, earnings, and price variations over time.

## Project Objectives

The Tableau dashboard was created with the following goals in mind:

1. **Identify Top 10 Highest-Earning Properties**  
   Analyze and present the top 10 properties with the highest earnings on the platform.
   
2. **Explore Price-Earnings Relationship**  
   Visualize the relationship between property prices and their earnings to understand how pricing affects revenue.

3. **Determine High-Earning Locations**  
   Identify which specific locations (or shores) generate the highest earnings to help the business target profitable regions.

4. **Analyze Price-Reviews Correlation**  
   Investigate the relationship between property prices and customer reviews to determine how pricing impacts customer satisfaction and property performance.

## Project Highlights
